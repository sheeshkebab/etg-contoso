Hi {{ tower_user_name }},

Your workshop jumphost has been provisioned.

It will be automatically torn down at this time to save on resource costs

{{ future_date }}

Note, this is +48 hours from provisioned time

You may login via ssh with the ec2-user account and password.
{% set jumphostName = "jumphost_" + ec2_name_prefix  %}
ssh ec2-user@{{ hostvars[jumphostName]['ansible_host'] }}


Individual student dev environments can each be found at the following locations,

{% for user, port in hostvars[jumphostName]['user_coder_details'].iteritems() %}
 - http://{{ hostvars[jumphostName]['ansible_host'] }}/{{ user }}/
{% endfor %}
